# To-Do App

### Why?
The standard first project for those learning web dev.

### What is it?
I decided to make a calendar app akin to Google Calendar.
Calendar is generated using vanilla JS. Users can register/log in to the app, view any dates, add a new todo with a title, description, and a time range.
