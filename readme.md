    - clean up look! (bootstrap 4 beta)
    - make changes in how data is displayed in "/todo"
        - list all years, then choose month, display month as calendar (do all in a single page!)
        - complicated! :(
        - transition to a calendar app??
        - "/" dynamically create calendar using JS?
        - REBUILD NEW AND EDIT EJS!!! Tie-in to index.ejs. That way, users only need to pick from and to hours. select year, month, date in index! total overhaul. :(
        - REBUILD INDEX.EJS!
        - click on date and it shows todo-list (show ejs) for that date. Must pass on completeDate to backend.
        - add a back button when showing specific todos in a single date to last known calendar screen!
        - passed todos ejs variable to todoCalendar.js for use with displaying titles and creating links to show todos in a given date
        - make dates in calendar a certain height. display only first 2-3 items
        - move Add New Todo link only when showing todos in a single date
        - default index page should be current month and year - set completeDate obj values in todoCalendar.js
        - move code out of document-ready function
        - combine functional, oop, and make code more readable (how???)
        - remove arrows for monthlist and year; show year in monthlist.
        - make prev and next button usable with dates, not just month
        - work on add new todo page! remove add new todo and make it appear only in date? month?
        - hold prev and next buttons to go through months. See your Pomodoro javascript on github! https://github.com/rdollent/FCC_Pomodoro/blob/master/index.js
        - tackle xmlhttprequest javascript!
        - make year selection dropdown.
        - change designs, bootstrap (or foundation???), overall look and feel for ALL pages.
        - remove entries in calendar. instead, put a marker on to which dates have a todo.
        - remove change when clicking on a date and removing calendar. instead. click on date and reveal a div wihch contains all entries?
        - change previous and next innerText into icons
        - put indicator as to which date is selected.
        - detect height of calendar, screen height, apply appropriate height to list of todos (showtodos), overflow: hidden
        - move previous and next buttons right by title header (how? write btns id workaround)
        - separate buttons and title header with the rest of calendar!
        - tblHeader is redundant
        - make calendar fit mobile better
        - sort showTodos by hour, remove styling on links, limit characters for description, limit characters for desc display to ellipses (...)
        - do not show hours that are before the From hours on a new todo
        - remove month and year buttons - click on month header for monthList, click on year header for yearList!
        - separate todos today list and times (how? make separate divs, make them inline-block, all contain in todosDateList)
        - calculate screen height. if colHours and colTodos height < screenheight, fill it.
        - make it an SPA. Make routes into xmlhttprequests. how?
            - remove show route since all the data i'll need is already loaded. rework links.
            - modify edit route to work on single page.
            - how to detect when month has 28, 29, 30 or 31 dates? figure it out.
            - hours are in string format. generate strings in dialogue boxes for minutes and hours!
            - submit button in edit, submit click event verifies values and e.preventDefault() if incorrect or logically wrong
- Time
    - drop down?
    - interval? Must be to the minute
    - time and tasks are tied together!
    - how to detect overlapping times, and not record them or ask to overwrite them..
